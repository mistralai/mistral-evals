PROMPT = """Analyze the image and question carefully, using step-by-step reasoning.
First, describe any image provided in detail. Then, present your reasoning. And finally your final answer in this format:
Final Answer: <answer>
where <answer> is:
- The single correct letter choice A, B, C, D, E, F, etc. when options are provided. Only include the letter.
- Your direct answer if no options are given, as a single phrase or number.
- If your answer is a number, only include the number without any unit.
- If your answer is a word or phrase, do not paraphrase or reformat the text you see in the image.
- You cannot answer that the question is unanswerable. You must either pick an option or provide a direct answer.
IMPORTANT: Remember, to end your answer with Final Answer: <answer>."""
