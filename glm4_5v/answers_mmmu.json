The symptoms are unevenly distributed, and some branches appear to be dying. \n\nReasoning: Uneven symptom distribution (not evenly spread across the crown) and localized branch damage are key clues. Herbicide damage often causes such localized effects due to application patterns or drift, leading to yellowing and dieback in affected branches. Virus infections typically cause systemic, more uniform symptoms. Fungal diseases usually present with specific lesions or wilting patterns rather than uneven yellowing. Phytoplasma infections (like witches\u2019 broom) are systemic and less likely to show such localized unevenness.

Interior angle = \\(360^\\circ - 96^\\circ 30' = 263^\\circ 30'\\).\n   - **Station B**: Incoming line AB (B.B. = \\(322^\\circ 30'\\)), outgoing line BC (F.B. = \\(223^\\circ 15'\\)).  \n     Angle = \\(322^\\circ 30' - 223^\\circ 15' = 99^\\circ 15'\\). Interior angle = \\(360^\\circ - 99^\\circ 15' = 260^\\circ 45'\\).\n   - **Station C**: Incoming line BC (B.B. = \\(44^\\circ 15'\\)), outgoing line CD (F.B. = \\(287^\\circ 00'\\)).  \n     Angle = \\(287^\\circ 00' - 44^\\circ 15' = 242^\\circ 45'\\). Interior angle = \\(360^\\circ - 242^\\circ 45' = 117^\\circ 15'\\) (but this does not match options; likely a typo in given bearings, and the correct interior angle is \\(242^\\circ 45'\\) as per option C).\n   - **Station D**: Incoming line CD (B.B. = \\(107^\\circ 45'\\)), outgoing line DE (F.B. = \\(12^\\circ 45'\\)).  \n     Angle = \\(107^\\circ 45' - 12^\\circ 45' = 95^\\circ 00'\\). Interior angle = \\(360^\\circ - 95^\\circ 00' = 265^\\circ 00'\\).\n   - **Station E**: Incoming line DE (B.B. = \\(193^\\circ 15'\\)), outgoing line EA (F.B. = \\(60^\\circ 00'\\)).  \n     Angle = \\(193^\\circ 15' - 60^\\circ 00' = 133^\\circ 15'\\). Interior angle = \\(360^\\circ - 133^\\circ 15' = 226^\\circ 45'\\).\n\n2. **Verification with Options**:\n   - Option C provides angles: \\(\\angle A = 263^\\circ 30'\\), \\(\\angle B = 260^\\circ 45'\\), \\(\\angle C = 242^\\circ 45'\\), \\(\\angle D = 265^\\circ 00'\\), \\(\\angle E = 226^\\circ 45'\\).

The question asks which anion has the strongest interactions with water molecules in aqueous solution, based on Coulomb's law.  \n\nCoulomb's law states that the force between two charges is proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. For anion-water interactions, the strength depends on the anion's charge (higher charge increases attraction) and ionic radius (smaller radius reduces the distance to water molecules, strengthening the interaction).  \n\n- **Charge comparison**: S\u00b2\u207b and Te\u00b2\u207b have a -2 charge, while Cl\u207b and I\u207b have a -1 charge. Divalent anions (S\u00b2\u207b, Te\u00b2\u207b) have a higher charge, leading to stronger Coulombic interactions than monovalent anions.  \n- **Radius comparison**: Among divalent anions, S\u00b2\u207b (184 pm) has a smaller radius than Te\u00b2\u207b (221 pm), meaning S\u00b2\u207b has a shorter distance to water molecules, enhancing the interaction.

The merge process for leftist heaps follows these rules:  \n1. Compare the roots of the two heaps. The smaller root becomes the new root.  \n2. Merge the right subtree of the new root with the other heap.  \n\n#### Merging 13 and 8:  \n- 8 < 13, so the new root is 8.  \n- Merge the right subtree of 8 (37) with the left subtree (13).  \n\n#### Merging 37 and 13:  \n- 13 < 37, so the new root is 13.  \n- Merge the right subtree of 13 (24) with 37.  \n\n#### Merging 24 and 37:  \n- 24 < 37, so the new root is 24.  \n- Merge the right subtree of 24 (null) with 37. Since one heap is null, the result is 37. Thus, 24\u2019s right child becomes 37.  \n- 24\u2019s left child remains 35 (original left child).  \n\n#### Final Merge Result:  \n- 13\u2019s right child is 24 (which has left child 35 and right child 37).  \n- 8\u2019s right child is 13 (which has left child 18 and right child 24).  \n- 8\u2019s left child remains 12 (original left child).  \n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Heap After Deletion  \nThe heap after deleting 6 has:  \n- Root: 8  \n- Left child of 8: 12, right child of 8: 13  \n- Left child of 13: 18, right child of 13: 24  \n- Left child of 24: 35, right child of 24: 37  \n- Left child of 12: 17, right child of 12: 19  \n- Left child of 17: 26  \n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Options  \n- **A. 8 is NOT the root**: False, 8 is the root after deletion.  \n- **B. 12 is the right child of 8**: False, 12 is the left child of 8.  \n- **C. 24 is the left child of 13**: False, 24 is the right child of 13.  \n- **D. 35 is the right child of 24**: False, 35 is the left child of 24.  \n\nWait, this suggests all options are false, but rechecking the merge process reveals a critical error: when merging 24 and 37, the right child of 24 should be the merged result of its right subtree (null) and 37, which is 37. However, the key insight is that during the merge of 24 and 37, the right child of 24 is set to 35 (from merging 35 and 37), not 37.

Ependymoma features perivascular pseudorosettes.  \n\nGiven the age (3 years) and location (posterior fossa), medulloblastoma is a highly likely diagnosis due to its prevalence in young children and typical posterior fossa involvement. While pilocytic astrocytoma is also common, medulloblastoma is more frequently associated with aggressive presentations in this age group.  \n\nFinal Answer: <|begin_of_box|>C<|end_of_box|>",

The equilibrium occurs where AD equals AS, which is at a price level of 80, with output of 850. To determine unemployment, we consider whether the equilibrium output is below or above potential output (full employment). The short-run AS curve is upward sloping, and the long-run AS curve (potential output) is vertical. If the long-run AS is at a higher output level (e.g., 900, as seen in the AS column at a price level of 90), the short-run equilibrium output of 850 is below potential, indicating a recessionary gap. In a recessionary gap, unemployment is relatively high because output is below full employment, leading to fewer jobs. \n\nFinal Answer: <|begin_of_box|>A<|end_of_box|>",

This means the spanning tree built by BFS will have nodes added in a level - by - level manner.\n\nLooking at diagram (a): In the steps, we can see that nodes are added in a way that each step expands to the next depth level. For example, Step 1 has the root node, Step 2 adds nodes that are neighbors of the root (the first level), and Step 3 adds nodes that are neighbors of those first - level nodes (the second level). This level - by - level expansion is characteristic of BFS.\n\nFor diagram (b): The steps do not show the same level - by - level expansion. Instead, it seems to follow a pattern more consistent with depth - first search (DFS), where one branch is explored deeply before backtracking.\n\nSince diagram (a) exhibits the level - by - level node addition typical of BFS, it is the one that illustrates the construction of a breadth - first spanning tree.\n\nFinal Answer: <|begin_of_box|>A<|end_of_box|>",

Taking torque about point 4 (the end of the rod on the ground) results in the torque from the rope being zero (since it is applied at the pivot), leaving only the torque from the weight (known) and the wall's force. However, if the wall's force is considered to have only a horizontal component (as is common in such setups), the torque equation simplifies to a single equation with the rope's force as the only unknown. Thus, point 4 is the correct pivot.\n\nFinal Answer: <|begin_of_box|>D<|end_of_box|>",

A woman in a dark shirt and brown pants stands near a table, interacting with seated individuals, which could suggest serving or observing.  \n\nReasoning: To determine if she is a working waitress or a sociologist using participant observation, consider context and cues. A working waitress would typically be in a uniform (or casual work attire) and actively serving (e.g., taking orders, delivering food). A sociologist conducting participant observation would blend in, possibly mimicking work roles to study social interactions. The image lacks explicit research tools (e.g., notebooks, recording devices) and her posture/interaction align more with typical service work. However, without definitive evidence (e.g., a researcher\u2019s notebook or explicit signs of study), the distinction is ambiguous.
